# Great Adventure

This is a text-based adventure game written in Java. It is similar to Zork and Colossal Cave from way back. You must explore, find objects, kill trolls, and so on.

Why? I'm learning Java and wanted to take a break from courses and tutorials. I wanted to practise Java basics and writing this game was more fun than course exercises. It is probably bad Java and I only use the functions and features that I have learnt up to this point. There's so much still to learn. Have fun with it!
